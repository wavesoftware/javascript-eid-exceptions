EID Runtime Exceptions and Utilities for JavaScript

## Getting started

You'll need [node / npm](https://nodejs.org/) and [tsd](http://definitelytyped.org/tsd/) installed globally.  To get up and running just enter:

```
npm install
tsd install
npm run test
```

This will:

1. Download the npm packages you need
2. Download the typings from DefinitelyTyped that you need.
3. Compile the code and serve it up at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

Now you need dev tools.  There's a world of choice out there; there's [Atom](https://atom.io/), there's [VS Code](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/code-vs.aspx), there's [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/).  There's even something called [Visual Studio](http://www.visualstudio.com).  It's all your choice really.
